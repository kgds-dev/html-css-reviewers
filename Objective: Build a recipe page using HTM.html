Objective: Build a recipe page using HTML to display a recipe for a dish of your choice.

Instructions:

1. Create a new HTML file (e.g., index.html).

2. In the HTML file, create the basic structure of the recipe page:
    Add a DOCTYPE declaration.
    Create the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
    Inside the <head> section, add a <title> with the name of the dish.

3. In the <body> section, create the following elements:
    A header with the name of the dish and a short description.
    An image of the prepared dish.
    
    (CLUE: This should be in bullet form)
    A list of ingredients needed to make the dish. 
    Step-by-step instructions to prepare the dish.

4. Use appropriate HTML tags to structure the content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.
